# Predicting and explaining the impact of genetic disruptions and interactions on cell and organismal viability 


## File Description

- `ppc.py` creates the protein-protein interaction networks for the budding yeast, fission yeast, human, and fruit fly. 
- `create_tasks.py` generates the single-, double-, and triple-mutant tasks studied in the paper. It assumes that `ppc.py` has already been executed.

This repository includes the code to process source data and run all experiments and analyses in the paper. 

The code relies on Python 3.6+ and requires Tensorflow 2+ for modeling.
